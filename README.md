# Snake-Game
Snake Game in Java
This is a clone of the well known Snake Game where the goal is to eat as many apples as possible to increase the score while increasing the snake's length.

Running the snake's head into a border or the snake's body will result in the game ending.

The game's controls are the arrow keys.
